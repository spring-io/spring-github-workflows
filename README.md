# GitHub Actions Workflows for Spring Projects

This project contains reusable GitHub Actions Workflows to build Spring projects with Gradle or Maven.
And provides some other useful utilities to perform from GitHub Actions, such a Dependabot auto-merge, or automatic back-port issue creation.  
The workflows are designed for specific tasks and can be reused individually or in combinations in the target projects.

To use these workflows in your project a set of organization secrets must be granted to the repository:

```
GH_ACTIONS_REPO_TOKEN
DEVELOCITY_ACCESS_KEY
JF_ARTIFACTORY_SPRING
ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME
ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD
SPRING_RELEASE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL
OSSRH_S01_TOKEN_USERNAME
OSSRH_S01_TOKEN_PASSWORD
OSSRH_STAGING_PROFILE_NAME
CENTRAL_TOKEN_USERNAME
CENTRAL_TOKEN_PASSWORD
GPG_PASSPHRASE
GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
```

The Develocity secret is optional: mostly not used by Maven and Gradle project might not be enrolled for the service.  
The `SPRING_RELEASE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` secret is also optional: probably you don't want to notify Google Space about your release, or it is not available for GitHub organization.
As well as `OSSRH_*` secret, since not all releases might go to Maven Central, e.g. private (commercial) repositories only.

The mentioned secrets must be passed explicitly since these reusable workflows might be in different GitHub org than target project.

The SNAPSHOT and Release workflows uses [spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action](https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action) to publish artifacts into Artifactory.

## Build SNAPSHOT and Pull Request Workflows

The [spring-gradle-pull-request-build.yml](.github/workflows/spring-gradle-pull-request-build.yml) and [spring-maven-pull-request-build.yml](.github/workflows/spring-maven-pull-request-build.yml) are straight forward, single job reusable workflows.
They perform Gradle `check` task and Maven `verify` goal, respectively.
The caller workflow is as simple as follows.

#### Gradle Pull Request caller workflow:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/pr-build-gradle.yml#L1-L10

#### Maven Pull Request caller workflow:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/pr-build-maven.yml#L1-L10

You can add more branches to react for pull request events.

The SNAPSHOT workflows ([spring-artifactory-gradle-snapshot.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-gradle-snapshot.yml) and [spring-artifactory-maven-snapshot.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-maven-snapshot.yml), respectively) are also that simple.
They publish artifacts into `libs-snapshot-local` (by default) repository.
The Gradle workflow can be supplied with Develocity secret.

#### Gradle SNAPSHOT caller workflow:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/ci-snapshot-gradle.yml#L1-L18

#### Maven SNAPSHOT caller workflow:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/ci-snapshot-maven.yml#L1-L13

Both Gradle and Maven SNAPSHOT build workflow requires `ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME` & `ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD` secretes to authorise [spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action](https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action).
Optionally, all the artifacts can be signed if `GPG_PASSPHRASE` and `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets are provided.

## Release Workflow

The [spring-artifactory-gradle-release.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-gradle-release.yml) (and therefore [spring-artifactory-maven-release.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-maven-release.yml)) workflow is complex enough, has some branching jobs and makes some assumptions and expects particular conditions on your repository:

- The versioning schema must follow these rules: 3-digit-dotted number for `major`, `minor` and `patch` parts, snapshot is suffixed with `-SNAPSHOT`, milestones are with `-M{number}` and `-RC{number}` suffix, the GA release is without any suffix.
For example: `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`, `1.0.0-M1`, `2.1.0-RC2`, `3.3.3`.
- GitHub Milestone titles must be exact as the version to release number.
For example: `1.0.0-M1`, `2.1.0-RC2`, `3.3.3`.
- GitHub Milestones must be scheduled: have a `Due on` date set.
Otherwise, release workflow will be cancelled with a warning that nothing to release for respective SNAPSHOT in a branch.

The logic of this release workflow:

- Take a SNAPSHOT version from a dispatched branch (Maven `help:evaluate -Dexpression="project.version"` and Gradle `gradle properties | grep "^version:"`, respectively).
- List GitHub milestones matching the candidate version and select the closest one by due on date.
(The [spring-find-release-version](.github/workflows/spring-find-release-version.yml) reusable workflow is implemented for this goal)
- Cancel workflow if no scheduled Milestone
- Call Maven or Gradle (according to the workflow choice for the project in the repository) with the release version extracted from the previous job.
This job stages released artifacts using JFrog Artifactory plugin into `libs-staging-local` repository on Spring Artifactory and commits `Next development version` to the branch we are releasing against
- The next job is to [verify staged artifacts](#verify-staged-artifacts)
- When verification is successful, next job promotes release from staging either to `libs-milestone-local` or `libs-release-local` (by default) (and optional to Maven Central: if `bundleName` input is not provided) according to the releasing version schema
- Then [spring-finalize-release.yml](.github/workflows/spring-finalize-release.yml) job is executed, which tags release into GitHub, commits next development version, generates release notes using [Spring Changelog Generator](https://github.com/spring-io/github-changelog-generator) excluding repository admins from `Contributors` section.
The `gh release create` command is performed on a tag for just released version.
Then spring.io project page is updated for newly released version.
(The [spring-website-project-version-update](.github/actions/spring-website-project-version-update) local action is implemented for this goal).
And in the end the milestone closed and specific Google Space notified about release (if `SPRING_RELEASE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` secret is present in the repository).

#### Example of Release caller workflow:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/release.yml#L1-L25

Such a workflow must be on every branch which is supposed to be released via GitHub actions.

The `buildToolArgs` parameter for this job means extra build tool arguments.
For example, the mentioned `dist` value is a Gradle task in the project.
Can be any Maven goal or other command line arguments.

The signing released artifacts is done by the [spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action](https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action) if `GPG_PASSPHRASE` and `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets are provided.
In the end all the artifacts, together with their signatures, are uploaded to the Artifactory according to the respective workflow inputs.  

In the end you just need to go to the `Actions` tab on your project, press `Run workflow` on your release workflow and choose a branch from drop-down list to release currently scheduled Milestone against. 
Such a release workflow can also be scheduled (`cron`, fo example) against branches matrix.

#### Scheduler workflow example:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/schedule-releases.yml#L1-L19

> **Warning**
> The [spring-artifactory-gradle-release.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-gradle-release.yml) (and [spring-artifactory-maven-release.yml](.github/workflows/spring-artifactory-maven-release.yml)) already uses 3 of 4 levels of nested reusable workflows.
> Where the caller workflow is the last one.
> Therefore don't try to reuse your caller workflow. 

## Verify Staged Artifacts

The `verify-staged` job expects an optional `verifyStagedWorkflow` input (the `verify-staged-artifacts.yml`, by default) workflow supplied from the target project.
For example, [Spring Integration for AWS](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-aws) uses `jfrog rt download` command to verify that released `spring-integration-aws-${{ inputs.releaseVersion }}.jar` is valid.
Other projects may check out their samples repository and setup release version to perform smoke tests against just staged artifacts.

#### Verify staged workflow sample:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/verify-staged-artifacts.yml#L1-L28

## Backport GitHub Issue Workflow

The [spring-backport-issue.yml](.github/workflows/spring-backport-issue.yml) uses [Spring Backport Bot](https://github.com/spring-io/backport-bot) to create a back-port issue according to the event configured in a caller workflow.
See its documentation for labeling convention and respective GitHub events for calling this workflow.

#### Backport Issue caller workflow example:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/78b29123a17655f019d800690cc906d692f836a9/samples/backport-issue.yml#L1-L16

## Dependabot Support

If [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is enabled for repository, its config should set a label compatible with [Spring Changelog Generator](https://github.com/spring-io/github-changelog-generator).
Typically, it is `type: dependency-upgrade`.
It is also a good practice to group all the development dependencies into a single pull request from Dependabot.
This includes all the Gradle and Maven plugins and those dependencies which are used only for testing in the project.
This projects provides a [spring-merge-dependabot-pr.yml](.github/workflows/spring-merge-dependabot-pr.yml) reusable workflow to make modifications to the Dependabot pull requests.
However, there are some prerequisites to use this workflow in your project:
- Pull requests must be protected by some check to pass, usually a workflow to build the project with this pull request changes;
- The [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository) must be enabled in the repository (if `--auto` is used);

The `spring-merge-dependabot-pr` workflow does these modifications to the Dependabot pull requests:
- Modify label from `dependency-upgrade` to the `task` for the development dependencies group update to skip them from release notes by Spring Changelog Generator;
- Adds a currently scheduled milestone to the pull request against a snapshot version extracted from the target branch;
- And if milestone is scheduled, the pull request is queued for auto-merging after required checks have passed;
- If `autoMergeSnapshots` input is set to `true`, the upgrade from Milestone/Release Candidate dependency to its SNAPSHOT is going to be merged automatically without assigning a milestone to the PR.   

The `mergeArguments` input of this workflow is applied to the `gh pr merge` command. 

#### Dependabot merge pull request workflow example:
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-github-workflows/blob/710bf1214450ffb9a4d3a1cfbe12755ed2d59edc/samples/merge-dependabot-pr.yml#L1-L14

## Automatic cherry-pick workflow

The [spring-cherry-pick.yml](.github/workflows/spring-cherry-pick.yml) workflow offers a logic to cherry-pick pushed commit to branches suggested by the specific sentence in commit message.
For example `Auto-cherry-pick to 6.2.x & 6.1.x`.
The `Auto-cherry-pick` token is a default value for the `autoCherryPickToken` input of this workflow.
The branches to cherry-pick to are extracted from the matching sentence.
The "Auto-cherry-pick" sentence is remove from the target commit message.
The `-x` option of `git cherry-pick` command adds a link back to the original commit.

## Announce Milestone Planning in Chat

The [spring-announce-milestone-planning.yml](.github/workflows/spring-announce-milestone-planning.yml) workflow offers an automatic chat message publishing when `due_on` on the repository milestone is changed.
The callers workflow must be configured like this:
```yaml
name: Announce Milestone Planning in Chat

on:
  milestone:
    types: [ created, edited ]

jobs:
  announce-milestone-planning:
    uses: spring-io/spring-github-workflows/.github/workflows/spring-announce-milestone-planning.yml@main
    secrets:
      SPRING_RELEASE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SPRING_RELEASE_GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```
The workflow reacts to non-empty `due_on` property of the event's milestone payload and check if this property really was changed on milestone edit. 

## "Dispatch Workflow and Wait" Action

The [spring-dispatch-workflow-and-wait](.github/actions/spring-dispatch-workflow-and-wait/action.yml) action implements the logic to call `gh workflow run` for the provided workflow file and wait until it is complete, successful or not.
This action is used in the `verify-staged` job of the release workflow.

## Gradle Init Scripts

The `[deployment-repository-init.gradle](utils/deployment-repository-init.gradle)` script adds a Maven repository for publishing artifacts into a local directory (`/deployment-repository`) via respective `publishAllPublicationsToDeploymentRepository` Gradle task.
Then [spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action](https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-deploy-action) picks up those artifacts for uploading to the Artifactory.
The Maven build does that via `deploy` goal and respective `-DaltDeploymentRepository=local::file:deployment-repository` CLI option.
